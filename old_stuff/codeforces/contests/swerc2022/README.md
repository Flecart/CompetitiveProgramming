This year i partecipated at the SWERC competitions with one of the
three teams of University of Bologna.
We managed to solve 4 problems, and come at 39th position with those.
It was a fun adventure, and i hope to do it again the next year.

The problem which gave most problems was the current O, and the l during
the contest. (we bugged the implementation, inexplicably).
