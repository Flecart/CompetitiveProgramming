## Libraries folder

#### What is this for
Hello reader! This folder was though to store some implementation of some long algorithms or data-structure that cannot be found in C++ STL by default! I hope i'll make this bigger with time

#### What you can find
By now nothing... Just some algorithms...

#### How this should be used
You should just copy paste the algorithms you need for a problem.
