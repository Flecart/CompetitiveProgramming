This is a repository where i store my old Competitive programming files.
The old ones are usually not commented, i just keep them in this repository, at
least until it became pointless, which is when i realized i would never look back at old scripts and problems.

I'm not sure if the new ones should be detailed commented solutions, i don't think so, because
i think there is no point to store old solutions to small known problems, they are usually uninsteresting from 
a larger point of view.

So i think the best way you can view this repository is a *memory of old experiences*
