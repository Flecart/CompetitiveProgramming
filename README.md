## My Journey

Hello you all! I am exploring the competitive programming world! 
This repository is useful to document my journey, so that i can see in some years how far i come.
The commits will be used to register what i have done during these times in my journey in this world!

I am currently trying to deepen my knowledge about data-structures and algorithms, and CP seems a good way
to make it.

Below some useful links for me.

- [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/)
- [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- [cp-algos](https://cp-algorithms.com/)

Hope y'all have a great day!
